# [CNN]-[MNIST] - Simple Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This Kaggle notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of a simple classification task using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on the popular MNIST dataset.

MNIST is one of the most historic dataset.  
- Include in [Keras datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/datasets)

The notebook is organized into three distinct sections:

## Objectives
In this section, the specific objectives of the notebook are outlined. The main goals include:

- Training a DNN model to accurately recognize handwritten numbers.


## Implementation
This section focuses on the practical implementation steps involved in achieving the objectives mentioned earlier. The implementation steps include:

1. Data Retrieval: Obtaining the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
2. Data Preparation: Preprocessing and preparing the dataset for training the CNN model.
3. Model Creation: Designing and building the CNN model using Keras.
4. Model Training: Training the CNN model using the prepared dataset.
5. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model and evaluating the classification results.
